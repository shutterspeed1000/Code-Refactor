# Module 1 Challenge

## Description
Module 1 Challenge

* Challenge requested the following:
* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* WHEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

After updates:

* All div elements have been converted to semantic elements
* CSS and HTML were simplified using combined classes and elements (NAV, Section, etc..)
* CSS order was corrected to match the flow of the HTML code and sections of the page are commented for easy editing
* All image elements have alt attributes describing the image for screen readers.  "Hero" image was moved from CSS to html to allow for alt description.
* Heading were corrected to flow from 1-4
* Title was added
